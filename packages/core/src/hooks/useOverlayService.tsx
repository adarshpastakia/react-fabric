/**
 * Hook to manage overlay components like modals or flyouts.
 * It provides a way to open an overlay with specified properties and handle its closure.
 * This hook returns the current overlay component and a function to open it with props.
 * It is useful for scenarios where you need to display overlays dynamically,
 * such as modals, flyouts, or any other overlay components in a React application.
 * The `openOverlay` function returns a promise that resolves with the result
 * of the overlay when it is closed, allowing you to handle the result in a controlled manner.
 *
 * @param ModalOrFlyout - The component to be used as an overlay.
 * @returns An array containing the current overlay and a function to open it.
 *
 * @example
 * ```jsx
 * const [Overlay, openOverlay] = useOverlayService(MyModalComponent);
 * // To open the overlay:
 * const handleOpen = async () => {
 *   const result = await openOverlay({ title: "My Modal", content: "Hello World" });
 *   console.log(result); // Handle the result from the overlay
 * };
 * <button onClick={handleOpen}>Open Modal</button>
 * <Overlay />
 * ```
