and provide them with the necessary props and state management.

It uses the \`Controller\` component from \`react-hook-form\`
to manage the form state and validation.

It accepts a \`name\` prop to identify the form control,
and a \`children\` prop which can either be a React element
or a function that receives the necessary props to render the control.

The component will pass down the following props to the child:
- \`name\`: the name of the form control
- \`error\`: any validation error message
- \`checked\`: whether the control is checked (for checkboxes/radios)
- \`value\`: the current value of the control
- \`invalid\`: whether the control is invalid
- \`readOnly\`: whether the control is read-only (disabled during submission)
- \`disabled\`: whether the control is disabled
- \`onBlur\`: function to call when the control loses focus
- \`onChange\`: function to call when the control value changes
- \`ref\`: a ref to the control element
* The component also handles the \`ref\` prop to ensure that it is passed correctly
to the child component, allowing for proper focus management and DOM access.

@param {ControllerProps} props - The properties for the Controller component.
@returns {JSX.Element} The rendered Controller component.

@example
\`\`\`jsx
<Controller
  name="username"
  children={({ name, error, checked, value, invalid, readOnly, onChange }) => (
    <input
      type="text"
